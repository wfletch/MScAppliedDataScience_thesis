% ANNOTATE = First, this paper describes the basic encryption system that is used to mask a sent message, revolving around a shared key k.  k is the set of initial conditions that allows the encryption end to run a unified (chaotic) dynamical system, and the decryption end to synchronize with the unified system using Hamiltonian energy functions.  They then compare the chaos of the encoded message for different initial conditions alpha to vary the system from Lorenz to Chen to Lu and find it is impossible to decode the message at all if the encoder and receiver are running different systems.

% ANNOTATE = This article proposes a new method of encrypting picture files.  First, the order of the pixels is rearranged through a series of Arnold cat map functions involving two secret keys.  Then, the grey values of each pixel are distorted using Chen's chaotic system, a variation on the Lorenz system, using an additional three secret keys, as well as fixing a c parameter.  Because these chaotic systems are deterministic, they can be undone if the secret keys and parameters are known.  As the system is very sensitive to initial conditions, it is secure against brute force attacks.
