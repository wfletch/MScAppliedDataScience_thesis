 Create a traffic simulator:
 1) develop network traffic simulator - input files for network structure and moving items, output detailed status per heartbeat
 2) generate synthetic data (network structure, cars/data packages that will move along network)
 3) assign decision logic per moving object (shortest path [distance, cost, etc], random path, fixed vs dynamic)
 4) implement dynamic route changing (recalculate routes based on network status)

Next steps:
1) create a server and API for storing and accessing simulation data
2) create a web interface for the running simulation
3) implement toggles to change variables in real time
